# SAFE TURN INDICATION SYSTEM

## Motivation

Now-a-days road accident has become a major threat to human life. The contribution of accidents
which happen near the blind turnings is significant. Lack of proper road safety measures has led
to a significant increase in road accidents. The rapid increase in the number of road accidents has
increased the need for a proper safety indication system. The project ‘Safe Turn Indication
System’ is one such simple safety system by which accidents can be avoided by indications.

## Objective of the project

The main aim of ‘Safe Turn Indicating System’ is to alert the driver using automated display
and buzzer which is monitored by sensor and microcontroller system. The key component in
current system is the IR beam sensor which triggers an internal relay whenever an obstacle
interrupts the IR beam.
